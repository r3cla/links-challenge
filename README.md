## My process

### Planning
- I viewed the available design files available for the challenge.
- I then planned the layout with a focus on the card element and a mobile first view.

### Development
- Drafted the HTML structure, focusing on my use of semantic tags.
- Connected the CSS file to the HTML and set up all the basic styling such as the Intern font.
- Added custom styles for the title, subtitle and bio sections of text on the card (social links area above the buttons).
- Ensured colours and other style elements were consistent with the design.
- Worked on getting the margins and alignment correct while constantly checking a live example of the webpage for reference.
- Tested it on my mobile device to see how it looked.
- 
### Testing
- I tested the layout using firefox responsive design mode to view in different screen sizes.
- I also viewed the website natively using my desktop PC and mobile phone.
- I validated my HTML and CSS code using w3.org. While not necessary, I think it can be useful for newbies.

### Reflection
- Again, this project was simple but great for someone at my level. I think I am learning alot and building good habits.

### Future Improvements
- I'd like to explore more streamlined ways of building CSS.


### Built with

- HTML5 - for structuring the content of the webpage.
- CSS custom properties - for defining reusable variables for colors, font sizes, etc.
- Visual Studio Code - as the code editor to write and manage the project code.
- Github Pages - For deploying the live example.
- Mobile-first design approach - starting the design for smaller screens and scaling up for larger screens if necessary.

### What I learned
- Better use of semantic tags.
- Honing my use of alignment style code such as padding, margins, etc. etc.

## Useful resources

- [Github Pages](https://www.pages.github.com) - This helped me easily deploy a live example of my website for free, straight from my github repo.
- [W3 Validator](https://w3.org/) - Good for spotting common problems in your HTML and CSS code.
- [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - Great for asking questions and getting help to troubleshoot your code.
- [ChatGPT](https://openai.com) - Great for proof reading and finding any sneaky problems within your code. Also helpful for providing a starting point, so long as you understand the code it is outputting.
